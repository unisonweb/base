# Unison base libraries

This includes basic data types and functions for the [Unison](http://unisonweb.org) language. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute.

## Deprecation Note

This repository contains historical versions of base. Unison code hosting for this library has migrated to [Unison Share](https://share.unison-lang.org/@unison/p/code/latest/namespaces/public/base/latest).  

## Installation

From the Unison Codebase Manager (`ucm`) prompt:

```
.> pull https://github.com/unisonweb/base:v3:.releases._latest .base
```

This will install the libraries into your codebase, under a namespace called `.base`.

## Usage

In Unison:

```
use .base
```

## What's here?

You can explore this library using the Codebase Manager (`ucm`). After installation (see above), type `cd .base`, then use the `ls`, `cd`, and `view` commands to explore.
